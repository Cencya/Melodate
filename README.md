# Melodate
# Introduction
Melodate is a music-based dating app.

Based on our experiences with dating apps we've used, we found that most matches didn’t lead to real connections. Oftentimes, the matches didn’t have much in common, and it was hard to find topics to talk about, which made the experience less enjoyable.

To address this, we came up with the idea of using music preferences as the main way to match people. By focusing on something as personal and relatable as music, we hope to provide users with a better experience.

Why Music?
- Personal and relatable: Music is a universal language that connects people on a deeper level.
- Easier conversations: Shared music interests provide a natural way to start a conversation.
- More genuine: Unlike traditional dating apps that match based on a few general traits, our method aims to offer a more authentic connection.
