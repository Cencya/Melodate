# Melodate
# Introduction
Melodate is a music-based dating app. Based on our experiences with dating apps we had used, we found that most matches didn’t lead to real connections. Oftentimes, the matches didn’t have much in common, and it was hard to find topics to talk about, which made the experience less enjoyable. Based on these experiences, we came up with the idea of using music preferences as the main way to match people. By focusing on something as personal and relatable as music, we hope to give users a better experience where they can connect over their shared interests, it gives a natural way to start conversations and seems more genuine than the traditional dating app method, where users often get matched based on just a few general traits.
